\section{Discussion}

\subsection{Design Choices}
The operational semantics for SEQUENCE carries the entire burden of propagating exceptions from one command to the next, in case the post-state of one, and thus the implicit pre-state of the next is exceptional. There are a few reasons for doing it this way:

\begin{itemize}
\item It simplifies the evaluation relation, since there is no need to explicitly model the concept of an exceptional pre-state
\item We avoid having to add an additional rule for every command that makes it explicitly behave as SKIP in the presence of an exception
\end{itemize}

This way, any command that can be put in a sequence will implicitly be skipped if the post-state of the first command is exceptional.
