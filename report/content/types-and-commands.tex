\section{Types and Commands}

We introduce three concepts to IMP: exceptional state, heap and functions.

An exceptional state



Variables, exceptions, and functions are identified by instances of the types \verb|id|, \verb|exid|, and \verb|funid|, respectively.

A state, $\sigma$, is a function space $\verb|id| \rightarrow \mathbb{N}$

A heap, $omega$, is a function space $\verb|id| \rightarrow \mathbb{N}$

An exception state, $\epsilon$, is define as $(\verb|exid|\times[\mathbb{N}])_\bot$

A function is represented by the triple $\verb|func|: \verb|com| \; \times \; [id] \; \times \; \verb|aexp|$
